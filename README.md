# Parse XML to JSON and save it to a database (mlab).

![alt text](img/1.png)

1. I have used a library called xml2json to parse this [XML File](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/simplexmldata/data.xml).

2. Then, I added a functionality to save that pasred data to be saved on mlab database which is hosted on heroku.

3. I have also written a function that parse the XML file but the function I wrote has some limitations and it doesn't prarse text attribute.

`This is the reason I didn't use my function to parse and save the JSON file to the database.`
